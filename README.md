Hypothesis:

The degree of eutrophication and the frequency of agricultural activities are positively correlated from April,2018 to April, 2019.

Analysis Plan:

1. make a line plot demonstrating the anomalies of both sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration from 1982 to 2019

2. make a plot demonstrating global sea surface temperature in 1982 and 2019

3. make a line trend chart demonstrating total nitrogen content versus each season from April, 2018 to April, 2019

4. make a stacked bar plot monthly demonstrating total phosphorus content from April, 2018 to April, 2019


Data Resource:

1. Sea Surface Temperature: (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/fileServer/Datasets/noaa.ersst.v5/sst.mnmean.nc)

2. Total Nitrogen: (https://api.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data-extraction/request/2109.adcc072/files/2109.adcc072-collected.csv)

3. Total phosphorus (the inserted datasets are dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), dissolved organic phosphorus (DORP) , particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP)):(https://api.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data-extraction/request/2110.705202c/files/2110.705202c-collected.csv)
