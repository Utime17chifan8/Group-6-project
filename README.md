# Group-6-project
Hypothesis:

The degree of eutrophication and the frequency of agricultural activities are positively correlated from April,2018 to April, 2019.

Analysis Plan:

1. make a double-line graph for the change of chlorophyll content over time from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

2. make a trend diagram for changes in temperature and chlorophyll content from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

3. Combine the three variables of time, temperature and chlorophyll concentration to model the three-dimensional graph from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

4. make a line trend chart demonstrating total nitrogen content versus each season from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

5. make a stacked bar plot demonstrating total phosphorus content monthly from April, 2018 to April, 2019.
