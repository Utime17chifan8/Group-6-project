### Backgound
> The timeline of this project is from April, 2018 to April, 2019. There are two sites in the project, Princess Charlotte Bay (site 1) and Mackay (site 2).
> The location of site 1 is (-14.434600,144.081600), of site 2 is (-21.2411,149.2713).
 
### Questions:

1. To understand the influence of agricultural activities on the location and extent of eutrophication by examining nitrogen and phosphorus indicators.
2. To understand the influence of seasonal factors on chlorophyll concentration in water bodies.

### Analysis Plan:

1. Make a double-line graph for the change of chlorophyll content over time from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

2. Make a trend diagram for changes in temperature and chlorophyll content from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

3. Combine the three variables of time, temperature and chlorophyll concentration to model the three-dimensional graph from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

4. Make four line trend chart demonstrating total nitrogen content versus every season from April, 2018 to April, 2019.

5. Make a stacked bar plot demonstrating total phosphorus content monthly from April, 2018 to April, 2019.
